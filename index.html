            <!-- <h1>How to create this app</h1>
            Write an API to communicate with database. Through this, we need to log time spent by user, words used by
            user (in database, associated with a level of difficulty). Plus in the database, we need to add words +
            associated clues to be presented to user.

            How is the crossword graphic generated? Is it simply that one square is filled in white with a black border? -->



            <!-- TENTATIVE: 3 Tables.

            1. Log user info (names + email + target lang see: signup.html)
            2. crossword info (words + definitions)
            i. each word has associated difficulty. in the interest of time, this will be systematically determined by
            length of the word (imperfect proxy)
            3. log time spent by user (to be displayed to user on improvement page) -->
